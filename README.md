# Sitemap Generator for any website
This is a simple python script that generates a sitemap for any website. It uses the requests library to get the HTML content of the website and then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract the links.


# Conclusion

Life is way much faster and easier if you uses python instead of getting stuck on those silly nodejs npm packages. Python is the best language for web scraping and automation. It is easy to learn and has a lot of libraries that can help you in your projects.

Completely wasted more than 2 hour to build the costume sitemap generator using node and typescript and was not worth it. I should have used python from the start.


Use Python and Stay Happy! ðŸ˜Š
